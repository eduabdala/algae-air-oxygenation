# Algae-Based Air Oxygenation ðŸŒ¿

This project utilizes algae to oxygenate enclosed spaces, creating a natural ecosystem that helps improve air quality in a sustainable way.

## Project Status: **Researching**
I am currently researching the best types of algae and designing the system that will regulate light and air circulation. The next step involves testing the algaeâ€™s oxygen production under different conditions.

## Technologies Used (Planned)
- **Microcontroller**: Raspberry Pi or Arduino
- **Language**: Python or C/C++ (depending on the controller)
- **Components**: LEDs, Air pumps, CO2 sensors

## Features (Planned)
- Automatic light control to promote algae photosynthesis
- CO2 level monitoring and air oxygenation control

## Installation (Future)
Instructions for installation will be provided once the implementation phase begins.

## Algae Used
Researching different types of algae like **Chlorella** for this project.
